#  Maze Solver with BFS and OpenCV
This project demonstrates a simple maze-solving algorithm using Breadth-First Search (BFS) in conjunction with OpenCV for visualization. The user can interactively select the start point of the maze, and the program will find a path to the goal while displaying the progress in a graphical window.
 # Features
 * Maze Visualization: The maze is drawn using OpenCV, with different colors representing walls, visited cells, and the current path.
 * Interactive Start Selection: Click on the maze to select the starting point. The maze cells are visually updated to reflect the selection.
 * Breadth-First Search (BFS): The BFS algorithm is used to explore the maze and find the shortest path from the start to the goal.
 # Requirements
 * OpenCV: You need OpenCV installed to compile and run this program. Install it using your package manager or build it from source.
